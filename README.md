# Spam-Ham-classification
You can identify your email is spam or not by natural language processing(NLP).
# Spam Email Detection

This project uses machine learning to classify SMS messages and emails as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. The model is trained using a Naive Bayes classifier and is capable of identifying spam emails based on their content.

## Project Overview
Spam email classification is an important task in email filtering systems, and this project attempts to tackle this by training a **Naive Bayes classifier** on a dataset of labeled SMS messages. After training, the model can be used to predict whether a given email or message is spam or not.

### Features
- Classifies SMS or email as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
- User can input any email or SMS to check its spam status.
- The model is trained using a dataset of labeled spam and ham messages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for implementing the solution.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and stopword removal.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning and the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **re**: Regular expression library for text cleaning.
- **CountVectorizer**: For converting text data into numeric feature vectors (Bag of Words model).

## Installation Instructions
